# odin-etchasketch
 Simple etch-a-sketch game that is made up of a default 16x16 grid of divs. The user can reset the grid with dimensions of their choosing (3 <= x <= 100). The site uses the mouseover event to check for when the user is hovering over a square, and then changes the background-color of the div to a random RBG    value.
